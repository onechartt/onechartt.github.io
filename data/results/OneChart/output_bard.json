In the given picture, square A is the base of the right triangle, square B is the height of the right triangle, and square C is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.\n\nWe are given that the areas of squares A and B are 5 and 3 respectively. This means that the side length of square A is $\\sqrt{5}$ and the side length of square B is $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the side length of square C. So we have:\n\n$(\\sqrt{C})^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2}$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{25 + 9}$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{34}$\n\nThe area of square C is $C^2 = 34$.

This allows them to control for other factors that could affect the speed of the snowboard, such as the rider's technique or the slope of the hill.\n\nBy comparing the average time it took to slide down the hill with wax to the average time without wax, they can determine whether waxing the snowboard makes it slide down the hill faster.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it asks about the difference between a thin layer of wax and a thick layer of wax. The experiment only compares the time it takes to slide down the hill with wax to the time it takes to slide down the hill without wax.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it asks about the effect of waxing the snowboard on its acceleration. The experiment only measures the time it takes to slide down the hill, not the speed at which the snowboard is traveling.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it is not a specific question that can be answered by the experiment. The experiment can only compare the time it takes to slide down the hill with wax to the time it takes to slide down the hill without wax. It cannot say anything about how much faster the snowboard will slide with wax.\n\nSo the best question that Linda and Bob's experiment can answer is (B): Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?",

        "response": "The diameter of a circle is twice the radius. Since $\\overline{AB}$ is a diameter, we have $AB=2r$. We are also given that $AC=8$ inches and $BC=15$ inches. Using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ABC$, we have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$. Plugging in the known values, we get $2r^2=8^2+15^2=289$. Solving for $r$, we get $r=\\sqrt{289/2}=\\boxed{8.5}$ inches.\n\nNote that we could have also found the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.

        "response": "Sure, I can help you with that.\n\nThe answer is **(B). 70\u00b0**.\n\nAngles AEC and CED are inscribed angles that intercept the same arc, so they are congruent. Therefore, m\u2220AEC = m\u2220CED = 105\u00b0.\n\nAngles AED and ECD are opposite angles, so they are supplementary. Therefore, m\u2220AED + m\u2220ECD = 180\u00b0.\n\nSubstituting m\u2220AEC = 105\u00b0 and m\u2220CED = 105\u00b0, we get m\u2220AED + 105\u00b0 + 105\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\nSolving for m\u2220AED, we get m\u2220AED = 70\u00b0.\n\nFinally, since \u2220AED and \u2220C are corresponding angles, they are congruent.
