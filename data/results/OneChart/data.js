Since all the sides of a rhombus are equal, each angle in a rhombus is equal to 180 degrees - 360 degrees/4 = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees.\n\nAngles F and J are opposite angles in the rhombus, so they are supplementary angles. Therefore, $m\\angle F + m\\angle J = 180^\\circ$.\n\nSubstituting in the expressions that were given for each angle, we get $(x + 20^\\circ) + (x - 5^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $2x + 15^\\circ = 180^\\circ$.\n\nSubtracting 15 degrees from both sides, we get $2x = 165^\\circ$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $x = 82.5^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, $m\\angle H = (x + 10^\\circ) = (82.5^\\circ + 10^\\circ) = \\boxed{92.5^\\circ}$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.

In the given picture, square A is the base of the right triangle, square B is the height of the right triangle, and square C is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.\n\nWe are given that the areas of squares A and B are 5 and 3 respectively. This means that the side length of square A is $\\sqrt{5}$ and the side length of square B is $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the side length of square C. So we have:\n\n$(\\sqrt{C})^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2}$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{25 + 9}$\n\n$C = \\sqrt{34}$\n\nThe area of square C is $C^2 = 34$.

    "response": "The answer is (D), tadpole.\n\nAlgae is the base of the food chain in the image, so all of the other organisms rely on it for food.

However, the tadpole would be the most affected because it is a herbivore and relies almost exclusively on algae for food.\n\nThe tilapia is a carnivore and would be able to find other sources of food, such as insects or small fish. The common water flea and great diving beetle are omnivores and would also be able to find other sources of food, such as detritus or small animals.\n\nSo the tadpole is the correct answer because it is the organism that would be most affected by the elimination of algae."

The experiment only compares the time it takes to slide down the hill with wax to the time it takes to slide down the hill without wax.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it asks about the effect of waxing the snowboard on its acceleration. The experiment only measures the time it takes to slide down the hill, not the speed at which the snowboard is traveling.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it is not a specific question that can be answered by the experiment.

The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is smaller than that at x=5.\n\nThe derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the line tangent to the function's graph at that point. The steeper the line, the larger the derivative. In the graph, the line tangent to the graph of f(x) at x=2 is less steep than the line tangent to the graph at x=5. Therefore, the derivative of f(x) at x=2 is smaller than that at x=5.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the derivative of f(x) is given by the expression f'(x) = 2x - 3.
