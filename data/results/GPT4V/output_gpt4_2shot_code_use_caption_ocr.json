The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts.

It exerts a force that is proportional to its displacement from its equilibrium position.\n* **Mass:** The mass is a small object that has a certain amount of inertia. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion.\n* **Surface:** The surface is a flat object that the mass is resting on. The surface is frictionless, which means that there is no friction between the mass and the surface.\n* **Spring force:** The spring force is the force that the spring exerts on the mass. The spring force is directed towards the spring's equilibrium position.\n* **Displacement:** The displacement of the mass is the distance between the mass's current position and its equilibrium position.\n* **Negative work:** Negative work is work that decreases the energy of a system. In this case, the spring force does negative work on the mass, which decreases the mass's kinetic energy.\n* **Decreasing speed and kinetic energy:** The spring force causes the mass to slow down, which decreases its kinetic energy.
