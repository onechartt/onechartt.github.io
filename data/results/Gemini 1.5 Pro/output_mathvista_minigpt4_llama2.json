The work done on the canister by the spring is given by:\n\n$$W = F \\cdot displacement$$\n\nwhere $F$ is the force exerted by the spring and $displacement$ is the distance over which the force is applied.\n\nThe force exerted by the spring is given by:\n\n$$F = k \\cdot displacement$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the spring constant.\n\nSince the displacement of the canister is constant, we can set it equal to the distance over which the force is applied:\n\n$$displacement = d$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for work, we get:\n\n$$W = k \\cdot d$$\n\nSince the canister starts with a speed of $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, it does work on the spring as it compresses it:\n\n$$W = -k \\cdot d \\cdot v$$\n\nUsing the law of conservation of energy, we can equate the work done on the spring to the energy transferred to the canister:\n\n$$W = U$$\n\nwhere $U$ is the energy transferred to the canister.\n\nSubstituting the above equations, we get:",
